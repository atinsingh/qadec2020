## WHAT IS FRAMEWORK
Its structure to solve the particular problem 
## Automation Framework 
Type
<ul>
    <li>Data Driven</li>
    <li>KeyWord Driven</li>
    <li>Hybrid</li>
</ul>

### Data Driven Framework
Data Driven Framework is an automation testing framework 
in which input values are read from data files and stored into variables in test scripts. It enables testers to build both positive and negative test cases into a single test   

Testflow is based on the dataflow 

[alt data](files/img.png, "data driven")

### Keyword Driven Framework
Flow is governed by set of keyWord
Example 
we have following keyword
<ol>
    <li>OpenBroswer</li>
    <li>Login</li>
    <li>AddProduct</li>
    <li>AddToCart</li>
</ol>

When you design test cases, you mix and match the keyword

### Hybrid 
When you inject data in keyword driven framework you can treat this as hybrid implementation

### Expectation 
1. Reusable 
2. Manage Test Data
3. Generate Execution Reports( Management and Details)
4. Manage Test Cases
5. Integration 
6. Manage Different Browsers
7. Generate Artifact/Evidences
8. Extendable (Configurable)
